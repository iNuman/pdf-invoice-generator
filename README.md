## 1. Installation

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```

Add the gradle dependency to your `app` module `build.gradle` file:

```
implementation 'com.github.kariot:pdf-invoice-generator:1.0.1'
```
## 2. Storage & Permissions
Invoice generator creates and saves pdf files in to the app specific folder ```Android/<YOUR PACKAGE>/files/<FILE NAME>.pdf```, so it will work without any permissions, but you have to configure File Provider for the app.

Create ```provider_paths.xml``` inside ```res/xml``` with content
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <external-path name="external_files" path="."/>
</paths>
```
In ```AndroidManifest.xml``` place the following code inside ```<application>``` tag.
```
   <provider
            android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider"
            android:authorities="${applicationId}.provider"
            android:exported="false"
            android:grantUriPermissions="true">
            <meta-data
                android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
                android:resource="@xml/provider_paths" />
        </provider>
```
## 3. Initialization of Data Sources
The invoice has been divided into different blocks for the convinience to build the layout and these blocks are shown below. These blocks requires specific set data to build.
